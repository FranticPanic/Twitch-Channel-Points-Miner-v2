# Twitch Channel Points Miner (Armi1014 Fork)

A reliability-first fork of `Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2` focused on practical day-to-day use: faster startup, clearer priority behavior, stronger watch streak handling, drops resilience, reports, and cleaner subscription notifications.

This project is not affiliated with Twitch. Use it at your own risk and make sure you understand the platform rules before using automation tools.

## Requirements

- Python `>=3.10`
- Git
- `uv` recommended for setup
- `pip`/venv fallback supported through `requirements.txt`

## Quick Start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FranticPanic/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2
cd Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2
cp example.py run.py
uv sync
uv run run.py
```

Edit `run.py` before the first real run. Most users only need to set `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, and `STREAMERS`.

Hermes is the default websocket backend. To force the legacy PubSub transport, set `USE_HERMES = False` in `run.py`.

## Docker Compose

Create the local configuration and persistent-data directories once:

```sh
cp example.py run.py
mkdir -p cookies logs analytics
```

Edit `run.py`, then pull the published image and start the miner:

```sh
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f miner
```

Compose pulls `ghcr.io/franticpanic/twitch-channel-points-miner-v2:latest`, which supports Linux AMD64 and ARM64 hosts. `run.py` is ignored by Git and mounted read-only into the container. Keep it private if it contains a password. Login cookies, logs, reports, and analytics survive image updates in their matching host directories.

If the first login needs an interactive prompt, run `docker compose run --rm miner`; after login succeeds and the cookie is saved, start the normal background service with `docker compose up -d`.

Stop the service with `docker compose down`. This leaves the persistent host directories intact.

## Monthly Upstream Updates

The `Sync from upstream` GitHub Actions workflow runs on the first day of every month at 06:17 UTC. It uses GitHub's fork-sync API to merge the upstream `Armi1014/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2` default branch into this fork's `master` branch. A merge conflict makes the workflow fail instead of overwriting fork-specific changes.

Every push to `master`, including a successful monthly sync, publishes updated AMD64 and ARM64 images to GitHub Container Registry with both `latest` and commit-specific tags.

GitHub disables scheduled workflows by default on new public forks. Enable the workflow from the fork's Actions tab after the first push.

## Pip Fallback

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
cp example.py run.py
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

On Windows, activate the venv with `.venv\Scripts\activate`.

## First Config Checklist

- Set your Twitch account in `USERNAME`.
- Use `PASSWORD = None` if you want the miner to ask at startup instead of storing the password in `run.py`.
- Add channels to `STREAMERS`.
- Mark important channels with `StreamerSettings(favorite=True)` if `Priority.FAVORITE` is in your priority order.
- Drops are enabled by default through `claim_drops=True`.
- Daily reports are enabled by default; weekly, monthly, and yearly reports can be enabled separately.
- Keep `USE_HERMES = True` unless you need to troubleshoot with the legacy PubSub transport.

See [example.py](example.py) for a complete starter config.

## What This Fork Improves

- Faster startup on medium and large channel lists.
- More resilient Twitch API, GQL, and websocket handling.
- Better watch streak behavior for already-online channels and delayed Twitch signals.
- Predictable favorite priority behavior.
- Drops inventory claiming and campaign matching that keep working through flaky Twitch campaign discovery.
- Cleaner Excel reports with daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly folders.
- Hidden local state files under `logs/.state/` so the root `logs/` folder stays cleaner.
- Self-only subscription notifications for Discord and other webhook-style integrations.

For implementation history and deeper notes, see [FORK_FEATURES.md](FORK_FEATURES.md).

## Watch Streaks

The miner now treats Twitch watch streaks conservatively:

- `WATCH` means normal watch points were awarded.
- `WATCH_STREAK` is treated as a hint that Twitch may have awarded the streak.
- The miner marks a streak completed only after Twitch's streak day count increases.

This matters because Twitch can send misleading streak signals. The miner keeps retrying pending streaks through the current broadcast instead of stopping on a false alarm.

More streak details are in [FAQ.md](FAQ.md).

## Weekly Rewards And Streak Recovery

Weekly visits and missed-stream recovery are enabled by default, adapted from
[mpforce1's fork](https://github.com/mpforce1/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner).
One background worker tries a clip first, then an accessible VOD for offline
channels. Successful playback requests alone never count as success: Twitch
must confirm the visit or restored streak.

- Weekly visits run only when Twitch reports an active event for your account
  and channel, with an unearned visit today. Completed or expired events stay
  idle. `Priority.WEEKLY_REWARDS` prioritizes eligible live channels; put it after
  `Priority.DROPS` to keep drop progress first.
- Recovery requires a streak of at least three broadcasts and an unexpired
  recovery window reported by Twitch. Only clips/VODs from the missed broadcast
  qualify. Recovery preserves the previous count and never claims the current
  live broadcast. Live channels continue through the normal streak watcher.
- Attempts are limited to 30 seconds for a clip and eight minutes for a VOD,
  with one job at a time and a one-hour cooldown per unsuccessful job. Deleted,
  unavailable, and subscriber-only VODs are skipped.

Disable either feature globally with `TwitchChannelPointsMiner(...,
weekly_rewards=False, watch_streak_recovery=False)`, or per channel with
`StreamerSettings(weekly_rewards=False, watch_streak_recovery=False)`.
Advanced limits use `RewardAutomationSettings` from
`TwitchChannelPointsMiner.classes.RewardAutomation`, passed as
`reward_automation_settings=RewardAutomationSettings(...)`.

These features depend on Twitch's eligibility and private APIs. See Twitch's
[weekly rewards rules](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/weekly-rewards) and
[watch streak recovery rules](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/recover-watch-streaks).

## Drops

Drops depend on two things:

- Twitch accepting playback/watch activity for the stream.
- Twitch GQL queries returning current inventory, campaign, and claim data.

This fork keeps drops claiming running when `claim_drops=True`, treats common Twitch campaign discovery failures as non-fatal, and uses fallback campaign matching when highlighted campaign IDs are missing.

The current drops-related Twitch GQL hashes are checked against live Twitch behavior and compared with [mpforce's working implementation](https://github.com/mpforce1/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner). Twitch can still return transient `service timeout` or backend errors; those are Twitch-side and the miner should continue running.

## Subscription Notifications

This fork can send `Events.SUBSCRIPTION` notifications to Discord or other webhook-style integrations.

It listens for:

- Twitch IRC `USERNOTICE` events.
- Twitch websocket gift-sub signals that can arrive even when the account is not present in chat.

It alerts only for subscription events about your own account:

- you subscribe
- you renew a subscription
- you receive a sub gift
- you upgrade a gift or Prime subscription

It ignores subscription events for other viewers.

Notes:

- IRC subscription notices still require chat to be enabled for that streamer.
- `chat=ChatPresence.NEVER` disables only the IRC subscription path for that channel.
- Websocket gift-sub notices use the same `Events.SUBSCRIPTION` message format and are locally deduped.

## Reports And State Files

Reports are written under `logs/reports/` by period:

- `logs/reports/daily/`
- `logs/reports/weekly/`
- `logs/reports/monthly/`
- `logs/reports/yearly/`

Daily reports keep all point columns. Weekly, monthly, and yearly reports show only the point columns relevant to that period.

Local state files are kept in `logs/.state/`, including:

- watch streak cache
- daily points baselines
- subscription notification dedupe data

On first startup after updating, legacy state files from `logs/` are copied into `logs/.state/` automatically. The old files are left in place as backups.

Do not delete files inside `logs/.state/` unless you intentionally want to reset local report and watch streak history.

## Troubleshooting

- For setup and config questions, see [FAQ.md](FAQ.md).
- For feature details and reliability notes, see [FORK_FEATURES.md](FORK_FEATURES.md).
- For a complete runnable config, see [example.py](example.py).
- For contribution notes, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Common runtime notes:

- Occasional `503`, `service timeout`, or Twitch backend errors can happen and are usually transient.
- For debug logs, set `LoggerSettings` to `logging.DEBUG` and inspect the newest file under `logs/`.
- If drops stop progressing, first check whether Twitch is accepting playback and whether recent GQL hashes are still valid.
